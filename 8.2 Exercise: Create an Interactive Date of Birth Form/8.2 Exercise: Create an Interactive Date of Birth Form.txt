-> Making Forms with Flask-WTF Lesson  
   -> Exercise: Create an Interactive Date of Birth Form  

-> Introduction  
   -> By now, you should be familiar with defining, rendering, and adapting your view functions to work with forms and fields  
   -> In this exercise, you will apply your knowledge to create a new route in your Flask application that displays a form asking for the user's date of birth  
   -> Once the user submits the form, the web application will flash a message displaying their Zodiac sign (e.g. Libra, Cancer) or their Chinese Zodiac animal (e.g. Rat, Ox)  

-> DateField  
   -> To accomplish this, you will use a field in your form that is specifically designed to accept dates  
   -> The DateField is like other fields in Flask-WTF, in that it also accepts a label  
   -> You will need to ensure that the user cannot submit the form without entering a valid date  
   -> This is done by setting validation rules on the DateField to require a date entry  

-> View Function  
   -> As you have learned, you will need a view function to handle the logic of the form  
   -> Define your view function and make it the handler for the route `/zodiac`  
   -> In this view function, you will create an instance of the form  
   -> The function should check if the form has been submitted and is valid  
   -> When the form is successfully validated, you will redirect the user to the index page (`/`)  

-> Template  
   -> Create a new template file called `zodiac.html` to render the form  
   -> This template should inherit from the base template `base.html`  
   -> In `zodiac.html`, render the form created in the view function  
   -> The form should be the only thing displayed on the page, but you are encouraged to get creative and add additional styling or content if desired  

-> Flash a Message  
   -> After the user submits the form, you will want the web application to display a message indicating their Zodiac sign or Chinese Zodiac animal  
   -> This can be done by using Flask's `flash` function to display a message on the page  
   -> To calculate the user's Zodiac sign or animal, you can use basic logic based on their birthdate  
   -> If you need help with this calculation or encounter any issues with the Flask-WTF library, you can ask for help on the course's Discord or consult your mentor  

-> Have Fun!  
   -> The most important part of this exercise is to have fun with it!  
   -> People tend to learn best when they enjoy what they're doing, so feel free to experiment and add personal touches to your form  
   -> Don't worry too much about making it perfect'you're preparing to dive into more advanced topics, like databases, in the next section  
   -> Forms and database interaction are closely linked, as forms allow users to submit data that can then be stored in a database  

-> Mentorship Makes the Difference!  
   -> Remember, you don't have to learn alone'there's support available through the CodingNomads 1-on-1 Mentorship Program  
   -> By joining the programme, you will have access to:  
      -> A dedicated team of mentors and advisors who are committed to your success  
      -> Weekly 1-on-1 screen share meetings with your personal, professional mentor  
      -> Continuous, personalised support seven days a week via Discord  
      -> Accountability, feedback, encouragement, and guidance to help you succeed  

-> Example Routes and Files  
   -> The route `/zodiac` will handle the display and submission of the form  
   -> Your form will be rendered using the template `zodiac.html`, which inherits from `base.html`  
   -> You will use `datetime.date` from Python's `datetime` module to handle and manipulate the user's birthdate  
   -> Flash messages will be used to show the Zodiac sign or Chinese Zodiac animal once the form has been submitted
